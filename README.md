# Data Mining Project Fall 2023
## Global Warming Temperatures

Data Mining project for Data Mining Class. We wil be using Kaggle
for most of our database references in regards to our topic proposal.

This project will outline the relationships between similar datasets that
will be represented visually. 

Python is going to be used to acheive our data visualization and 
relationship representation. (Using the appropriate libraries/modules)

This Project is aligned to our preference and interest on Global Warming 
related data sets that we can use to create our own or establish a relationship
that can outline a much larger and abstract dataset. Also, it is to show our
own knowledge that we have absorbed throughout the semester in this course.
